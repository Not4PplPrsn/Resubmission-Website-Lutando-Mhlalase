                    We got starte about one hundred and fifty years ago, during the Crimean war where icons like Florence Nightingale were revolutionizing the nursing profession. However, we are name after a local hero here who also ,in no small part, contributed to the betterment of not only but medical practices across the board, her name was Mary Seacole. During this time Mrs. Seacole was also active in the Crimea and was infact at odds with Mrs Nightingale, as her expertese was undermined, being that she was at the time a mulato or as we know mixed raced. 
                    Shortly after the Crimea Mrs Seacole then start to train student in the Jamaica in the profession of nursing, and the student were diverse in their origins and creeds. This, apprenticeship she began as a way to ensure that knowledge and skill which she acrued during her career would surevive for along time, turned into something more, The Mary Seacole Nursing School.
